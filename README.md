## hey 👋

I'm Sandani and this github is kinda a mess rn but yeah, it's a work in progress 🧩

---

### what I do
- frontend stuff → `html`, `css`, `js`
- backend-y stuff → `python`, `java`, `c`
- mostly just code for fun tbh 😅

---

### what I like
- 🏑 Playing Hockey(even in the uni team)
- 📚 reading random books(physiological and anything with a good plot)
- 🎮 playing games (a *lot*)
- 🍥 watching anime
- 💻 experimenting with code & random side projects

---

### 🛠 Current project  
working on an android app to track my spending 💸  
still learning kotlin but planning to make something clean & useful  
(stay tuned 👀)

---

### Goals
I wanna build cool stuff, learn cool stuff, and contribute *something* that makes the world a little better 🌍  
even if it's just a small open-source fix or a project that helps someone out 🙃

---

this github isn't perfect (yet), but i'm working on it 🚧

> just tryna learn, chill, and make something good ✌️
